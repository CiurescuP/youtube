A Youtube Clone project made at the end of a HTML & CSS course from SuperSimpleDev! This course helped me realize a lot about designing a whole page, the importance of HTML semantics and how taking CSS step by step makes your life a lot easier. At the end of the 6 and a half hours of the course, I followed along with SuperSimpleDev, but I felt like it was too simple, so I added a few elements to the sidebar which I'm really proud of.
